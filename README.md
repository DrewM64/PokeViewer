#PokeViewer

A simple project that uses basic HTML/CSS/JS to take data from PokeAPI and displays it on the webpage. Works by inputing the Pokemon's name into the search bar. 

FEATURES: 
-Search bar with spelling suggestion: typing into the search bar will bring up spelling suggestions for the Pokemon's name. Currently limited to a small list of favorites.
-Pokemon info: Official artwork, name, height, weight, type(s), abilities, cry
-Species info: Pokedex entries from first two english appearances (i.e. Diamond and Pearl for Pokemon introduced in gen 4)
